# VacTrack REQ System

The VacTrack REQ platform is the interface through which state, local, and territorial health departments and distribution teams can request vaccine shipments and VacPack teams. 
The REQ platform also integrates the related manufacturing, supply chain, allocation, state and territory planning, delivery and administration of both vaccine products and ancillary kits.

# VacTrack ExIS External Demographic Information System
The VacTrack ExIS is a smart, technological AI interface which is exclusively designed and developed for Haiti in order to enhance the process of vaccine distribution through which state, local, and territorial health departments can process vaccine requests by uploading data from their IIS (Immunization Information System) to VacTrack system AI.
IIS, also known as “vaccine registries,” are confidential, population-based, computerized databases for recording information on vaccine doses. IISs will be maintained by a jurisdiction’s immunization program. In many jurisdictions, routine vaccination providers enroll in public vaccine programs, order vaccines, report inventory, document vaccine spoilage/wastage, and remind patients when vaccine doses are due using the IIS. IIS allows monitoring of immunization history and compliance based on immunization schedule. The IIS is specifically designed to be the source of truth for vaccines supply, ordering, tracking, and monitoring in all the independent states of Haiti.

The VacTrack ExIS (External Information System) interface is a means for Haiti citizens to process vaccine requests by uploading data from their Immunization Information System (IIS) to VacTrck.

ExIS operators already rely on their IIS to collect and consolidate data from vaccination providers and to sustain effective immunization strategies through the use of clinical decision support, vaccination coverage reports, interoperability with electronic health record systems, vaccine inventory management, and reminder/recall messages. Adding IIS vaccine ordering functionality as part of an interface between VacTrck and the IIS builds on trustful relationships between the users and the providers, provides an additional incentive for vaccination providers to participate in IIS while promoting greater accountability for publicly-purchased vaccine.

# SUPPLY Platform

The “SUPPLY” platform integrates the related manufacturing, supply chain, allocation, state and territory planning, delivery and administration of both vaccine products and ancillary kits. This technology provides visibility across all Haiti jurisdictions to provide decision support and ease the burden of public health officials throughout the nation.
